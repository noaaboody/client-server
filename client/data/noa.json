1980 - japan:

GOOOAAALLL!!! Germany lead!!! Gundogan finally has success in the box as he steps up to take the penalty, sends Gonda the wrong way, and slots the ball into tne left-hand corner to put Germany 1-0 up! A needless penalty to concede from Japan's point of view, and after a bright start, the Samurai Blues trail!
